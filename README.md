Hi, I’m @francoisbessette. 

I worked at Cisco for several years as an embedded developper. Lots of C and embedded coding experience.
However now I am enjoying an early retirement and experimenting with other
technology such as Wordpress development.

I enjoy rock and ice climbing, camping and travelling.
You can reach me at francois.bessette@gmail.com
